### CY8CPROTO-063-BLE BSP
The PSoC 6 BLE Prototyping Kit (CY8CPROTO-063-BLE) is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of PSoC 6 MCUs. This kit is designed with a snap-away form-factor, allowing users to separate the KitProg (on-board programmer and debugger) from the target board and use independently.

### What's Included?
The CY8CPROTO-063-BLE library includes the following:
* BSP specific makefile to configure the build process for the board
* cybsp.c/h files to initialize the board and any system peripherals
* cybsp_types.h file describing basic board setup
* Linker script & startup code for GCC, IAR, ARM toolchains
* Configurator design files (and generated code) to setup board specific peripherals
* .lib file references for all dependent libraries
* API documentation

### Supported Software and Tools
This version of the CY8CPROTO-063-BLE BSP was validated for compatibility with the following Software and Tools:
