# CY8CPROTO-063-BLE BSP

## Overview

The PSoC 6 BLE Prototyping Kit (CY8CPROTO-063-BLE) is a low-cost hardware platform that enables design and debug of PSoC 6 MCUs. This kit is designed with a snap-away form-factor, allowing users to separate the KitProg (on-board programmer and debugger) from the target board and use independently.
